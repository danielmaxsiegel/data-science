# Daniel Siegel - Data Science Project Portfolio
Hello! My name is Daniel, and I'm a data scientist in training from Toronto. After completing a bachelor's degree in computer science and working as a professional software engineer for a few years, I decided to go back to school and complete a postgraduate program in [artificial intelligence at George Brown](https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/applied-ai-solutions-development-program-t431) in order to pivot my career and become a full stack data scientist.

This repository contains examples of the work that I've done so far. Please take a look, and feel free to reach out!
